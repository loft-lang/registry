"""PKG.REG R9 — `loft-lang/registry` PR validation.

Drop this file at `tools/validate.py` in the `loft-lang/registry`
repo.  Wired in by `.github/workflows/pr-validate.yml` (also in this
template directory).

Four gates per PR:

1. **Schema lint** — every package + version row has the required
   fields, types match, schema_version is unchanged; AND every package
   carries correct docs (non-empty description, non-empty categories,
   http(s) homepage) so the auto-generated library catalogue can never be
   incomplete — a doc-less library is invisible and gets reimplemented.
2. **Tarball verify** — download every newly-added `versions.<v>.url`,
   hash it, compare to the PR's declared sha256.  Reject on
   mismatch.  Caught: publisher pasted wrong hash, tarball was
   re-uploaded after PR opened, opportunistic supply-chain swap.
3. **Reproducible-build re-check** — for each newly-added version
   whose homepage points at a public GitHub repo, clone the tag,
   run `loft package`, compare the produced sha256 to the PR's
   claim.  Caught: source repo's tag points at different bytes
   than the uploaded release tarball.
   Also re-derives the `api` field from the cloned source and
   rejects a pasted one that disagrees, so `loft search` can never
   point at a function the source does not have.

4. **Trigger uniqueness** — every Tier-1 `method:receiver` trigger
   must be owned by at most one package across the whole registry.
   A consumer auto-loads a library from a bare `obj.method()` call,
   so two packages claiming `text.matches` would make the auto-load
   ambiguous.  Caught: a new library claiming a method-on-type
   trigger another package already owns.

Exits 0 on all-pass; non-zero with line-prefixed errors on any
failure.  The workflow surfaces those lines as PR comments.

    ## Single-package vs multi-package chunk-repo homepages

    For a **single-package repo**, `homepage` is the repo root
    (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>`), the tag is `v<version>`,
    and `loft package` runs at the repo root.

    For a **multi-package chunk repo** (e.g. `loft-libs-core` hosts
    `arguments`, `crypto`, `random` in separate subdirectories), the
    convention is:

      - `homepage` = `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<branch>/<pkg>`
      - tag = `<pkg>-v<version>` (so `arguments-v0.1.1` not `v0.1.1`)
      - `subpath` field carries `<pkg>` (also extractable from the homepage)

    Both shapes coexist in the registry today: `time`, `markdown`,
    `html` (planned) are single-package; `arguments`, `crypto`,
    `random`, `shapes`, `gridmesh`, `web`, `server`, `game_protocol`
    are multi-package chunk-repo members.
